# Predicting the Impact of Environmental and Health Factors on Mental Health

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between environmental and health factors and their impact on mental health disorders globally. Using data from 1990–2019 for over 180 countries, machine learning models were developed to predict mental health prevalence and provide actionable insights to aid global health strategies.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed global datasets focusing on air pollution, physical inactivity, dietary habits, and other health metrics.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Bidirectional LSTM**: Achieved high predictive accuracy (**R² = 0.904**) for mental health prevalence.
  - **Linear Regression and SVR**: Used for comparative analysis and validation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **PCA** to reduce complexity and highlight critical predictors.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented **MinMax scaling** and outlier removal to enhance model reliability.
